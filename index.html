    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With a strong background in core network operations and data infrastructure, I bring several years of industry experience in managing large-scale telecommunication systems and roaming network services across South Asia and Southeast Asia. Before beginning my Ph.D., I held technical and strategic roles at Novotel Limited, Robi Axiata Limited, and Axiata Group Wholesale, where I contributed to system architecture design, roaming service integration, and network optimization for voice and messaging infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Currently at Temple University, my work involves teaching and cutting-edge research projects such as intelligent cloud networking, topology-aware knowledge distillation in edge networks, and the application of large language models in healthcare systems. My current focus lies in advancing scalable and intelligent cloud-networking solutions that enhance performance across distributed systems.</p>

    <p>In addition to my research, I hold several certifications in system administration, database management, and Python programming. I actively contribute to collaborative projects in academic and professional environments. My work is grounded in a deep understanding of both practical telecom challenges and theoretical advances in networked computing.</p>
